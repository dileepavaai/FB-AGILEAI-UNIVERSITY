    <h1>Governance & Institutional Integrity</h1>

    <p>
      Safeguarding academic rigor, professional credibility,
      and long-term institutional trust.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page outlines how Agile AI University operates
      as an independent Academic & Professional Body,
      with clear governance boundaries and accountability.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= INSTITUTIONAL STATUS ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Institutional Status</h2>

    <p>
      Agile AI University operates as an
      <strong>independent Academic & Professional Body</strong>
      focused on defining capability standards,
      assessment frameworks, and professional recognition
      for Agile AI and Agentic AI domains.
    </p>

    <p>
      The institution is not positioned as a training vendor,
      coaching firm, or content marketplace.
    </p>

    <p>
      Its primary role is to establish clarity, structure,
      and professional reference standards in a rapidly
      evolving discipline.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Governance Principles</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Independence of academic judgment</li>
      <li>Clear separation of assessment, learning, and credentials</li>
      <li>Transparency of standards and frameworks</li>
      <li>Protection against credential dilution</li>
      <li>Long-term professional credibility over short-term growth</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= SEPARATION OF FUNCTIONS ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Separation of Functions</h2>

    <p>
      Agile AI University maintains strict separation between
      the following institutional functions:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Academic frameworks and reference models</li>
      <li>Capability assessment instruments</li>
      <li>Professional pathways and alignment guidance</li>
      <li>Credential issuance and verification</li>
      <li>Learning delivery and program execution</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This separation ensures that no single activity
      improperly influences another, preserving
      academic integrity and professional trust.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= ASSESSMENT GOVERNANCE ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Assessment Governance</h2>

    <p>
      Capability assessments published by Agile AI University
      are designed as <strong>insight and reflection instruments</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      They are not examinations, certifications, or screening tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      Assessment results may inform professional pathways
      but do not automatically confer credentials, status,
      or endorsement.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= CREDENTIAL GOVERNANCE ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Credential Governance</h2>

    <p>
      Credentials are governed under formally approved
      academic and equivalency frameworks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Credential issuance applies only to approved
      professional programs and is subject to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>defined eligibility criteria</li>
      <li>capability alignment requirements</li>
      <li>ethical and professional standards</li>
      <li>revocation and review provisions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Open capability assessments do not carry
      credential or verification status.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= INDEPENDENCE & COMMERCIAL BOUNDARIES ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Independence & Commercial Boundaries</h2>

    <p>
      Agile AI University maintains clear boundaries
      between institutional governance and any
      commercial learning or program delivery activities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Academic frameworks and assessments are not
      designed or positioned as sales instruments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Professionals retain full autonomy in deciding
      whether to pursue any further engagement.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= REVIEW & EVOLUTION ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Review & Evolution</h2>

    <p>
      Governance structures, frameworks, and credential
      standards are subject to periodic review to ensure:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>continued professional relevance</li>
      <li>alignment with evolving AI practices</li>
      <li>ethical and societal responsibility</li>
      <li>institutional integrity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Updates are introduced deliberately and transparently,
      avoiding reactive or trend-driven changes.

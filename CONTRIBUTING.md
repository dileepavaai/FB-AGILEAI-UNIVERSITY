## Governance Rule: Assessment vs Executive Surfaces (LOCKED)

Agile AI University deliberately separates **assessment insight surfaces** from **executive decision instruments**.  
This separation is **architectural and non-negotiable**.

---

### Assessment Surfaces (`report.html`)
Assessment pages:
- May explain, guide, and orient users
- May include richer headers and footers
- May link to institutional, portal, and verification resources
- Serve learning, reflection, and insight purposes

Do **not** attempt to simplify these pages to look like executive instruments.

---

### Executive Instruments (`executive-insight.html`)
Executive Insight pages:
- Are decision-support instruments, not webpages
- Must use minimal, static headers
- Must not include navigation, marketing content, or learning copy
- Must remain PDF- and audit-safe
- Must not reuse shared site headers or footers

Do **not** add UX elements for “consistency” or “branding.”

---

### Non-Negotiables
- Do **not** unify headers or footers across assessment and executive pages
- Do **not** reuse marketing navigation inside executive instruments
- Do **not** refactor these differences away

Any change that blurs this boundary is a **governance violation** and will be rejected.

---

### Rationale
Assessment pages answer:

> “What does my assessment mean, and what can I do next?”

Executive instruments answer:

> “What does this signal mean for leadership and governance decisions?”

They must look and behave differently to preserve institutional credibility.

  <!-- INSTITUTIONAL OVERVIEW -->
  <section>
    <h1>Institutional Overview</h1>

    <p>
      Agile AI University builds upon the canonical standards defined by the Agile AI Foundation,
      operationalizing structured capability architecture, governed assessment systems,
      and professional recognition models for AI-enabled agility.
    </p>

    <p>
      The institutional mandate is architectural and governance-centered rather than commercial.
      Explicit structural separation is maintained between canonical standards (defined by the Foundation),
      capability architecture, assessment instrumentation, executive interpretation,
      and credential recognition.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CHARTER LAYER -->
  <section>
    <h2>Charter Framework</h2>

    <p>
      The institutional charter is articulated across three formally defined components.
      Each component defines a distinct dimension of institutional authority
      within the scope of application and professional capability development.
    </p>

    <div class="pillar">
      <h3>Institutional Mandate</h3>
      <p>
        Defines the scope of institutional application, long-term purpose,
        and alignment to the canonical standards established by the Agile AI Foundation.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="pillar">
      <h3>Institutional Structure</h3>
      <p>
        Clarifies architectural separation between canonical standards,
        capability architecture, assessment systems,
        executive interpretation, and professional recognition models.
      </p>

    <div class="pillar">
      <h3>Governance Boundaries</h3>
      <p>
        Establishes explicit non-commercial positioning commitments
        and structural guardrails preserving institutional neutrality
        and canonical alignment.

  <!-- GOVERNANCE CONTINUITY -->
  <section>
    <h2>Governance Continuity</h2>

    <p>
      Institutional credibility is preserved through version-controlled change
      management, architectural stability, and strict separation
      between canonical definition and institutional application.
    </p>

    <p>
      Public transparency is maintained through formal governance documentation
      and an actively maintained versioning matrix.

    <p>
      The Agile + AI Capability Assessment is a
      <strong>formally defined institutional reflection instrument</strong>
      governed under the academic standards of Agile AI University.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is designed to help experienced professionals understand how
      Agile execution, Artificial Intelligence fluency, systems thinking,
      ethical responsibility, and learning orientation currently manifest

    <p class="hero-subtitle">
      Defining capability, frameworks, and professional recognition
      for Agile AI and Agentic AI leadership.
    </p>

    <p>
      Agile AI University operates as an independent academic and professional body,
      advancing standards for AI-enabled agility, decision-making, and leadership.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= ROLE ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Our Role</h2>

    <p>
      Agile AI University exists to define
      <strong>what professional capability means</strong>
      in the era of Agile AI and Agentic AI — beyond tools, trends,
      or short-term certifications.
    </p>

    <p>
      We establish academic frameworks, capability assessments,
      and structured professional pathways that support experienced
      professionals navigating AI-driven transformation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= ACADEMICS ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Academics</h2>

    <p>
      Our academic work focuses on clarity, structure, and rigor —
      ensuring that Agile AI capability is understood as an
      integrated discipline across execution, systems, ethics,
      and leadership.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Agile + AI Capability Assessment</strong><br />
        A reflective, research-informed assessment providing insight
        into current capability across Agile execution, AI understanding,
        systems thinking, ethics, and change.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Academic Frameworks</strong><br />
        Formal reference frameworks defining the dimensions,
        principles, and boundaries of Agile AI and Agentic AI practice.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Professional Pathways</strong><br />
        Structured alignment pathways connecting assessed capability
        to advanced professional development tracks.

  <!-- ================= ASSESSMENT ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Agile + AI Capability Assessment</h2>

    <p>
      The Agile + AI Capability Assessment is designed as an insight
      and reflection instrument — not an examination, certification,
      or screening test.
    </p>

    <p>
      It helps experienced professionals understand how Agile, AI,
      systems thinking, ethics, and learning orientation currently
      show up in their work.

  <!-- ================= CREDENTIALS ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Credentials & Professional Recognition</h2>

    <p>
      Credentials issued under Agile AI University represent structured
      professional recognition aligned to formally defined capability standards.
    </p>

    <p>
      The capability assessment itself does not confer any credential
      or certification.

      separating academic frameworks, assessments, credentials,

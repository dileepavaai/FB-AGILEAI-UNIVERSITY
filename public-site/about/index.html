  <!-- INSTITUTIONAL OVERVIEW -->
  <section>
    <h1>Institutional Overview</h1>

    <p>
      Agile AI University operates as an independent institutional authority
      defining structured capability architecture, governed assessment systems,
      and professional recognition models for AI-enabled agility.
    </p>

    <p>
      The institution maintains explicit structural separation between
      capability definition, assessment instrumentation,
      executive interpretation, and credential recognition.
      Its mandate is architectural and governance-centered rather than commercial.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CHARTER LAYER -->
  <section>
    <h2>Charter Framework</h2>

    <p>
      The institutional charter is articulated across three structural components:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="/about/mandate.html">Institutional Mandate</a></li>
      <li><a href="/about/structure.html">Institutional Structure</a></li>
      <li><a href="/about/boundaries.html">Governance Boundaries</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Together, these components define scope of authority,
      operational separation principles, and explicit non-positioning commitments.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- GOVERNANCE CONTINUITY -->
  <section>
    <h2>Governance Continuity</h2>

    <p>
      Institutional credibility is preserved through version-controlled change
      management, architectural stability, and long-term orientation
      over short-term expansion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Public transparency is maintained through formal governance documentation
      and an actively maintained versioning matrix.
    </p>

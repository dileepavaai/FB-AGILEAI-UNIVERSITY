    <h1>Defining Professional Capability in the Age of Agile AI</h1>

    <p class="hero-subtitle">
      An independent academic and professional body establishing structured standards
      for Agile AI and Agentic AI leadership.
    </p>

    <p>
      Agile AI University defines capability frameworks, structured assessments,
      and professional recognition models designed to bring clarity, rigor,
      and governance alignment to AI-enabled agility.
    </p>

  <!-- ================= INSTITUTIONAL ROLE ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Institutional Role</h2>

    <p>
      Agile AI University operates as an independent academic and professional body
      defining what structured professional capability means in the era of Agile AI
      and Agentic AI — beyond tools, trends, or short-term certifications.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our work establishes formal reference models for capability development,
      structured assessment instruments, and aligned recognition pathways
      supporting experienced professionals navigating AI-driven transformation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= ACADEMIC & PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECTURE ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Academic & Professional Architecture</h2>

    <div class="pillar">
      <h3>Capability Standards</h3>
      <p>
        Structured definitions of integrated capability across execution,
        AI fluency, systems thinking, ethics, and leadership.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pillar">
      <h3>Academic Frameworks</h3>
      <p>
        Formal frameworks defining the principles, dimensions,
        and governance boundaries of Agile AI and Agentic AI practice.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pillar">
      <h3>Structured Assessment</h3>
      <p>
        Research-informed capability assessment designed for reflection,
        insight, and structured professional orientation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pillar">
      <h3>Professional Recognition</h3>
      <p>
        Credential models aligned to defined capability standards,
        separating academic assessment from formal recognition pathways.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Agile + AI Capability Assessment</h2>

    <p>
      The Agile + AI Capability Assessment provides structured insight into
      how Agile execution, AI understanding, systems orientation, ethical judgment,
      and learning agility currently manifest in professional practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      The assessment functions as an academic insight instrument.
      It does not function as an examination, hiring filter, or certification test.
    </p>

  <!-- ================= CREDENTIALS ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Credentials & Professional Recognition</h2>

    <p>
      Credentials issued under Agile AI University represent structured
      professional recognition aligned to formally defined capability standards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recognition pathways remain institutionally separated from
      assessment mechanisms, preserving governance integrity.

  <!-- ================= GOVERNANCE ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Governance & Institutional Integrity</h2>

    <p>
      Agile AI University operates with explicit governance boundaries
      separating academic frameworks, assessments, credentials,
      and programmatic implementations.
    </p>

    <p>
      This separation ensures institutional neutrality,
      academic rigor, and professional legitimacy.

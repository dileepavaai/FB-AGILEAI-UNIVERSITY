    <h1>Institutional Structure</h1>

    <p>
      Agile AI University operates through a structured separation
      of academic, assessment, and credential governance functions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Functional Separation</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Academic Function</strong> — frameworks, definitions, references</li>
      <li><strong>Assessment Function</strong> — insight-based capability instruments</li>
      <li><strong>Pathways Function</strong> — professional alignment guidance</li>
      <li><strong>Credential Governance</strong> — standards, eligibility, verification</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why This Structure Matters</h2>

    <p>
      Separating these functions ensures that no single activity
      improperly influences another.
    </p>

    <p>
      This protects academic integrity, prevents credential dilution,
      and preserves long-term professional credibility.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Relationship to Programs</h2>

    <p>
      Learning programs and professional tracks may align to
      frameworks and pathways defined by Agile AI University.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, program delivery remains distinct from academic
      governance and credential authority.

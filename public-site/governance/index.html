    <h1>Governance & Institutional Integrity</h1>

    <p>
      Agile AI University operates within explicitly defined governance
      boundaries designed to preserve institutional neutrality,
      structural integrity, and long-term professional credibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      Governance is not an auxiliary function of the institution —
      it is foundational to its architectural design.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Institutional Mandate</h2>

    <p>
      Agile AI University functions as an independent institutional authority
      defining structured capability architecture for AI-enabled agility.
    </p>

    <p>
      Its mandate is architectural and academic rather than commercial.
      The institution defines standards, evaluation models,
      and recognition pathways — it does not operate as a training vendor,
      certification marketplace, or recruitment intermediary.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Structural Separation of Functions</h2>

    <p>
      The institutional architecture maintains separation between:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Capability framework definition</li>
      <li>Assessment instrumentation</li>
      <li>Executive interpretation layers</li>
      <li>Professional recognition models</li>
      <li>Program delivery environments</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This separation prevents conflicts of influence and preserves
      academic independence across institutional functions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Assessment Governance</h2>

    <p>
      Assessment systems are structured multi-dimensional instruments
      designed for professional insight and orientation.
    </p>

    <p>
      They do not function as examinations, hiring filters,
      or automatic certification mechanisms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Assessment logic, scoring models, and interpretation layers
      are governed under formal version control protocols.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Credential Governance</h2>

    <p>
      Professional recognition pathways operate independently
      from open assessment mechanisms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Credentials are issued only under formally defined
      eligibility, equivalency, and review standards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Governance provisions include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Defined qualification criteria</li>
      <li>Ethical compliance requirements</li>
      <li>Revocation and review procedures</li>
      <li>Protection against credential dilution</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Change Management & Version Control</h2>

    <p>
      All institutional surfaces operate under declared structural,
      content, and assessment model version control.
    </p>

    <p>
      Structural changes require Structure Version increments.
      Language revisions require Content Version increments.
      Assessment logic changes require Assessment Model Version increments.
    </p>

    <p>
      This framework prevents undocumented architectural drift.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Independence & Commercial Boundaries</h2>

    <p>
      Agile AI University maintains clear boundaries between
      institutional governance and any external commercial
      learning or implementation environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Frameworks and assessments are not positioned as
      sales instruments or promotional mechanisms.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Institutional Transparency</h2>

    <p>
      The institution maintains a formal version registry
      documenting structural and content evolution across
      its public surfaces.

<h1>Credential Verification</h1>

<p>
Agile AI University issues digital credentials to individuals who successfully
complete designated programs or assessments.
</p>

<p>
Credential verification is provided to allow employers, institutions, and
third parties to confirm the authenticity of issued credentials.
</p>

<h2>What Verification Confirms</h2>

<p>
Verification confirms that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The credential was issued by Agile AI University</li>
  <li>The credential holder successfully completed the stated program or assessment</li>
  <li>The credential has not been revoked at the time of verification</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Verification Does Not Confirm</h2>

<p>
Verification does not:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Guarantee employment, promotion, or professional outcomes</li>
  <li>Indicate regulatory, statutory, or government accreditation unless explicitly stated</li>
  <li>Imply equivalency to academic degrees or licenses</li>
  <li>Endorse how a credential is represented or used by the holder</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use of Credentials</h2>

<p>
Credential holders are responsible for representing their credentials accurately
and in context.
</p>

<p>
Misrepresentation, misuse, or alteration of credentials may result in revocation
or public invalidation.
</p>

<h2>Verification Access</h2>

<p>
Official verification is performed through Agile AI University’s designated
verification platforms or links associated with issued credentials.
</p>

<p>
Verification results reflect the credential status at the time of inquiry.
</p>

<h2>Institutional Integrity</h2>

<p>
Agile AI University maintains credential records to uphold institutional integrity,
trust, and transparency.

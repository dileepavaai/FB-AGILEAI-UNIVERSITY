      <h1>Capability Architecture</h1>
      <p>
        Agile AI University defines structured capability architecture for AI-enabled agility.
        This architecture establishes integrated capability baselines across execution,
        conceptual fluency, systems thinking, ethics, and outcome-based prompting.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Institutional Foundation</h2>
      <p>
        The capability model formalizes what integrated performance means in
        AI-enabled environments. It provides a structured reference for evaluation,
        assessment design, and professional recognition frameworks.
      </p>

      <p>
        The architecture does not represent a curriculum or training ladder.
        It defines structured capability criteria and interpretive baselines
        for institutional measurement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Five-Dimension Capability Model</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Agile Execution Capability</li>
        <li>AI Conceptual Fluency</li>
        <li>Systems Thinking</li>
        <li>Ethics, Trust & Human Impact</li>
        <li>Outcome-Based System Prompting</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These dimensions are structurally embedded within the institutional
        assessment model and executive interpretive reports.

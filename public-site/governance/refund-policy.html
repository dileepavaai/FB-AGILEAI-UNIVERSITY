    <!-- ===== Training Programs ===== -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Training Programs</h2>

      <p>
        Agile AI University training programs are delivered as instructor-led
        educational services, conducted <strong>online and/or onsite</strong>,
        supported by prerequisite learning materials and guided exercises, strictly
        in accordance with the published course syllabus.
      </p>

      <h3>Enrollment and Commencement</h3>
      <p>
        Enrollment is confirmed upon receipt of the first payment or installment.
        Course delivery is deemed to have commenced once learning materials are
        shared or a live training session is conducted, whichever occurs first.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mode of delivery (online or onsite) does not affect the applicability
        of this refund policy.
      </p>

      <h3>Learning Materials</h3>
      <p>
        All prerequisite and course-related learning materials are provided after
        payment confirmation. Once shared or accessed, such materials are considered
        delivered and are non-returnable and non-reversible.
      </p>

      <h3>Training Session Delivery</h3>
      <p>
        Attendance in one or more live training sessions constitutes partial delivery
        of the training program, irrespective of the total number of sessions
        completed.
      </p>

      <h3>Refund Eligibility</h3>
      <p>
        Refunds are not applicable once course delivery has commenced. This includes,
        without limitation, cases where:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Learning materials have been shared or accessed, and/or</li>
        <li>Any live training session has been attended</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Partial participation, partial completion, or non-completion of the course
        does not entitle a participant to a full or proportional refund.
      </p>

      <h3>Pauses, Rescheduling, or Interruptions</h3>
      <p>
        Temporary pauses or rescheduling due to holidays, instructor availability,
        health-related reasons, or operational constraints do not negate or reverse
        training already delivered.
      </p>

      <h3>Scope of Training and Excluded Services</h3>
      <p>
        Training programs are limited to instructional content and example
        implementations within the defined syllabus. Requests for customized business
        advisory, end-to-end solution design, production deployment, or extended
        real-time debugging constitute separate professional services and are not
        included in training delivery.
      </p>

      <h3>Voluntary Withdrawal</h3>
      <p>
        If a participant voluntarily withdraws from a training program after delivery
        has commenced, all fees paid up to that point remain non-refundable.

    <h1>Academics</h1>

    <p>
      Academic frameworks, capability assessments, and professional pathways
      for Agile AI and Agentic AI.
    </p>

    <p>
      Agile AI University operates its academic function independently,
      defining standards and references for professional capability —
      not delivering short-term training or introductory programs.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= ACADEMIC MANDATE ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Academic Mandate</h2>

    <p>
      The academic function of Agile AI University exists to establish
      <strong>clarity, structure, and professional rigor</strong> in how
      Agile AI and Agentic AI capability is understood, assessed, and developed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our work is grounded in experienced professional practice,
      systems thinking, and ethical responsibility — addressing AI not
      as a toolset, but as a decision-influencing capability within
      complex organizations.
    </p>

    <p>
      All academic outputs are designed for mid-to-senior professionals,
      leaders, architects, and practitioners operating at advanced levels.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Agile + AI Capability Assessment</h2>

    <p>
      The Agile + AI Capability Assessment is a structured,
      research-informed reflection instrument.
    </p>

    <p>
      It enables professionals to understand how Agile execution,
      AI conceptual fluency, systems thinking, ethics, trust,
      and learning orientation currently manifest in their work.
    </p>

    <p><strong>The assessment is not:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>an examination or test</li>
      <li>a certification or credential</li>
      <li>a screening or eligibility filter</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Instead, it provides insight that may optionally be aligned
      to advanced professional pathways — without obligation,
      sales pressure, or automated enrollment.
    </p>

  <!-- ================= ACADEMIC FRAMEWORKS ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Academic Frameworks</h2>

    <p>
      Agile AI University maintains formal academic frameworks that define:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>core dimensions of Agile AI capability</li>
      <li>conceptual boundaries of Agentic AI in organizations</li>
      <li>systems-level interaction between AI, people, and governance</li>
      <li>ethical, trust, and responsibility considerations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These frameworks serve as reference material for professionals,
      organizations, educators, and governance bodies.

  <!-- ================= PROFESSIONAL PATHWAYS ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Professional Pathways</h2>

    <p>
      Professional pathways provide structured alignment between
      assessed capability and advanced development tracks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Agile AI University defines three primary professional pathways:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>P Track — Professional</strong><br />
        Advanced professional capability in Agile AI execution and integration.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>M Track — Master (Agentic AI)</strong><br />
        Deep specialization in Agentic AI systems, delegation,
        decision augmentation, and governance.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>L Track — Leadership & Product</strong><br />
        Strategic leadership, product stewardship,
        and organizational AI transformation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Pathways do not represent foundational or entry-level learning.
      They are designed exclusively for experienced professionals.
    </p>

  <!-- ================= ACADEMIC BOUNDARIES ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Academic Boundaries</h2>

    <p>
      To preserve institutional integrity, Agile AI University
      maintains strict separation between:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>academic assessment and credentialing</li>
      <li>professional recognition and program delivery</li>
      <li>framework definition and commercial training</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This separation ensures that academic outputs remain credible,
      non-promotional, and professionally defensible.

# 🔒 Phase-C Governance Record (FINAL)

**Organization:** Agile AI University  
**System:** Credential Architecture, Sharing & Verification  
**Phase:** Phase-C — Extended Credential Artifacts  
**Status:** FINAL · LOCKED · SHIPPED  
**Change Authority:** ❌ NONE (unless explicitly unlocked)  
**Freeze Date:** [DD Mon YYYY]  

---

## 1️⃣ Purpose of This Record

This document formally records the **completion and freeze of Phase-C**.

It confirms that Phase-C was executed **strictly within its authorized scope**, without modifying or weakening:

- Credential issuance
- Credential validity
- Credential sharing governance
- Verification authority
- Phase-B guarantees

Upon this freeze, **Phase-C artifacts become immutable**.

---

## 2️⃣ Preconditions (VERIFIED)

The following governance prerequisites were verified prior to freeze:

- [ ] Phase-B is FINAL · LOCKED · SHIPPED  
- [ ] Phase-B Governance Record exists  
- [ ] Phase-B → Phase-C Transition Record exists  
- [ ] Phase-C Governance Charter (v1.0) was active  
- [ ] Phase-C Implementation Checklist completed  
- [ ] No unresolved governance exceptions  

---

## 3️⃣ Phase-C Authorized Scope (CONFIRMED)

Phase-C implemented **only** the following authorized artifacts:

### A. University Certificate PDFs
- Formal, non-interactive institutional documents
- Representational only
- Referencing canonical credential records

### B. Trainer / Facilitator Authorization Artifacts
- Role-based, time-bound authorizations
- Independently revocable
- Explicitly non-credentialing

### C. Controlled Storage & Access
- Non-public, access-controlled storage
- User-initiated access only
- No public indexing or discovery

No additional artifact classes were introduced.

---

## 4️⃣ Explicit Non-Scope Verification (PASSED)

The following were explicitly **not** introduced during Phase-C:

- Credential issuance changes
- Eligibility or entitlement logic
- Assessment or scoring mechanisms
- OpenGraph or social preview changes
- Public sharing expansions
- Skill validation or ranking language

---

## 5️⃣ Artifact Inventory (REQUIRED)

The following Phase-C artifacts were implemented and verified:

### University Certificates
- Certificate schema: v1.0
- PDF generation pipeline: v1.0
- Certificate service module: implemented
- Storage & access controls: enforced

### Trainer Authorizations
- Authorization lifecycle rules: v1.0
- Authorization PDF service: implemented
- Revocation & expiry enforcement: verified
- Access restrictions: enforced

---

## 6️⃣ Architectural Integrity Confirmation

Phase-C execution preserved all architectural invariants:

- Rendering layers remain read-only
- No UI-driven entitlement logic
- Credential registry remains authoritative
- Verification system remains independent
- Phase-B artifacts remain unchanged

---

## 7️⃣ Governance Risk Review

| Risk Area | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------|------|
| Credential dilution | ❌ Eliminated | Certificates are representational only |
| Trainer misrepresentation | ❌ Eliminated | Role-based, revocable authorizations |
| Public overexposure | ❌ Eliminated | No public indexing |
| Scope creep | ❌ Eliminated | Checklist enforced |

No unresolved risks remain.

---

## 8️⃣ Compliance Statement

Phase-C complies with:

- Institutional neutrality principles
- Separation of issuance, rendering, sharing, and verification
- Lifetime validity terminology rules
- Non-gamified credential governance
- Audit and archival requirements

No exceptions recorded.

---

## 9️⃣ Freeze Declaration

> **Phase-C is hereby declared FINAL, LOCKED, and SHIPPED.**

All Phase-C artifacts are now immutable.

Any future modification requires:
- Explicit governance unlock
- New phase declaration
- Superseding governance record

    <h1>Start Here: Understanding Agile AI</h1>

    <p>
      This page is intended for professionals, leaders, and practitioners who are encountering
      the term <strong>Agile AI</strong> and want a clear, grounded understanding before forming
      opinions, making decisions, or pursuing any formal recognition.
    </p>

    <p>
      The material linked from this page is public, non-instructional, and designed to establish
      shared language and conceptual clarity in a rapidly evolving domain.
    </p>

    <h2>Before You Continue</h2>

    <p>
      This learning surface is part of the broader <strong>AgileAI ecosystem</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The conceptual foundations of Agile AI — including its philosophical grounding,
      institutional intent, and public-interest orientation — are established by the
      <strong>AgileAI Foundation</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are encountering Agile AI for the first time, or if you want to understand the
      <em>why</em> before the <em>how</em>, you are encouraged to review the Foundation’s work first.

    <h2>Why This Orientation Exists</h2>

    <p>
      Artificial intelligence is changing how decisions are made, how work is organized,
      and how leadership accountability is exercised. At the same time, widely used terms such as
      <em>Agility</em>, <em>Business AI</em>, and <em>AI readiness</em> are often used
      inconsistently or incorrectly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before tools, before frameworks, and before certification, there must be clarity.
      This orientation exists to establish that clarity.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Use This Page</h2>

    <p>
      There is no required sequence, no completion requirement, and no assessment.
      The sections below reflect a recommended reading path for building a coherent
      mental model — not a learning mandate.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Definitions</h2>

    <h3>Agility</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Agility</strong> is the capability to deliver the right outcome at the right time
      under conditions of uncertainty.
    </p>

    <h3>AI-augmented Agility</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>AI-augmented Agility</strong> is the capability to deliver the right outcome at the
      right time when sensing, decision-making, and adaptation are continuously informed and
      amplified by artificial intelligence.
    </p>

    <h3>Agile AI</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Agile AI</strong> is an integrated organizational capability that combines:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Agility</strong> — outcome-focused adaptation under uncertainty</li>
      <li><strong>Business AI</strong> — the focused use of AI to deliver business value now</li>
      <li><strong>Humics</strong> — the human, cultural, cognitive, and ethical dimensions that shape how AI is understood, trusted, and governed</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      Agile AI = Agility + Business AI + Humics
    </blockquote>

    <h2>What Is Business AI (and Why It Matters Now)</h2>

    <p>
      Artificial intelligence as a field is vast and fast-moving. Attempting to “learn all of AI”
      is neither realistic nor necessary for most professionals.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Business AI</strong> narrows the focus. It refers to the subset of artificial intelligence
      that can be applied to deliver business value in the present context — enabling decisions,
      actions, and outcomes starting now.
    </p>

    <p>
      Business AI helps professionals focus, prioritize relevance, and pivot intelligently
      as conditions change. It is a core component of Agile AI, not a replacement for it.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Myths and Misconceptions</h2>

    <p>
      A deeper exploration of common misconceptions is available in the
      <a href="myths-and-misconceptions.html">Myths & Misconceptions</a> section.
    </p>

    <h2>What Comes After Orientation</h2>

    <p>
      Some readers stop after achieving conceptual clarity. Others continue toward applied
      practice, assessment, or formal recognition.
    </p>

    <p>
      Institutional services are provided through the Student & Executive Portal,
      which operates separately from this public learning infrastructure.

    <h2>Boundary Statement</h2>

    <p>
      This orientation is not a course, certification program, or learning management system.
      It does not teach tools, prescribe practices, or assess competence.
      Its purpose is shared understanding.

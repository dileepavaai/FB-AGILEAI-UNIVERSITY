# GOVERNANCE CLOSURE NOTE — LEARNING PORTAL SCOPING
Status: CLOSED · GOVERNANCE CONFIRMED  
Date: 10 Feb 2026  
Authority: System Context Lock — AgileAI Foundation & Agile AI University

## CLOSURE SUMMARY
The concept of a unified “Learning Portal” is formally closed and retired.

The system now recognizes and enforces two distinct, non-overlapping surfaces:

1. Student & Executive Portal (public-portal/)  
— Institutional access, identity, entitlement, credentials, and Executive Insight.

2. Learning Content Surface (learning.agileai.university, hosted via docs/)  
— Static learning materials, reference content, and reading artifacts.

There is no combined or hybrid portal in architecture, governance, or execution.

## GOVERNANCE BASIS
This closure is enforced by:
- The System Context Lock
- The governance record PORTAL-VS-LEARNING-SURFACE-BOUNDARY

This note serves as the formal scoping closure to prevent ambiguity or future reinterpretation.

## TERMINOLOGY ENFORCEMENT
Effective immediately:
- “Learning Portal” — deprecated, must not be used
- “Student & Executive Portal”
- “Learning Content Surface”

This applies across code, documentation, UI, and communication.

## EXECUTION STATUS
Scoping is final and closed.  
Execution may proceed only within the defined surface boundaries.

CLOSURE STATE: LOCKED

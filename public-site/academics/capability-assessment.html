    <h1>Agile + AI Capability Assessment</h1>

    <p>
      The Agile + AI Capability Assessment is an
      <strong>academically governed reflection instrument</strong>
      designed to help experienced professionals understand how
      Agile, Artificial Intelligence, systems thinking, ethics,
      and learning orientation currently manifest in their work.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= PURPOSE ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Purpose of the Assessment</h2>

    <p>
      This assessment exists to establish
      <strong>clarity of professional capability</strong>
      in the context of Agile AI and Agentic AI —
      not to evaluate individuals for certification,
      ranking, or eligibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      It supports reflective insight across five dimensions:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Agile execution and adaptability</li>
      <li>AI conceptual fluency</li>
      <li>Systems thinking and integration</li>
      <li>Ethics, trust, and human impact</li>
      <li>Change and learning orientation</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= WHAT IT IS NOT ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>What This Assessment Is Not</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>It is <strong>not</strong> an examination or test</li>
      <li>It is <strong>not</strong> a certification or credential</li>
      <li>It is <strong>not</strong> a screening or hiring tool</li>
      <li>It does <strong>not</strong> issue verification or badges</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Completion of this assessment does not imply endorsement,
      qualification, or professional status.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= GOVERNANCE ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Academic Governance</h2>

    <p>
      The Agile + AI Capability Assessment is governed under
      the academic standards of Agile AI University,
      an independent Academic &amp; Professional Body.
    </p>

    <p>
      The assessment framework, signal interpretation,
      and reflection model are defined independently
      of any learning programs, credentials, or commercial offerings.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= OUTPUT ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Assessment Output</h2>

    <p>
      Upon completion, participants receive a
      structured insight report summarizing:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>capability signals across key dimensions</li>
      <li>integrated reflection observations</li>
      <li>non-prescriptive professional orientation guidance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Where appropriate, participants may optionally
      explore alignment with advanced professional pathways —
      without obligation or automated enrollment.

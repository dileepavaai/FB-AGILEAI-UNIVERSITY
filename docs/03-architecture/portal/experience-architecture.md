# Purpose

Defines the architectural standard governing every learner and executive
experience inside the Agile AI University Portal.

The platform is experience-driven rather than page-driven.

This document establishes the Experience Architecture that every future
experience must follow.

---

# Vision

The Portal is no longer organised around pages.

The Portal is organised around governed Experiences.

Each Experience owns its presentation while consuming shared platform
services.

Examples

• Credential Workspace

• Recognition Detail

• Learning Journey

• Assessment Summary

• Upgrade Registration

• Executive Insights

• AI Coach

# Experience Principles

Every experience shall

✓ Present information

✓ Consume Services

✓ Consume Published Assets

✓ Remain Stateless

✓ Follow Shared UI Standards

Experiences shall never

✗ Query Firestore

✗ Execute Business Rules

✗ Resolve Authorization

✗ Duplicate Services

✗ Regenerate Credential Assets

# Credential Workspace Architecture

The Credential Workspace is the reference implementation for all future
portal experiences.

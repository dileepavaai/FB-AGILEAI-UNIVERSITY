      <h1>Core Concepts</h1>

      <p class="lead">
        This page defines the foundational concepts that structure the Agile AI model.
        These definitions are institutional in nature and establish shared language
        across research, professional practice, governance, and credential pathways.
      </p>

      <p>
        The concepts below should be read as interrelated components of an integrated
        capability framework rather than isolated definitions.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Agility</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Agility</strong> is the capability to deliver the right outcome
          at the right time under conditions of uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Agility is outcome-oriented, context-sensitive, and decision-centric.
          It is not synonymous with speed, frameworks, or delivery mechanics.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>AI-augmented Agility</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>AI-augmented Agility</strong> is the capability to deliver the
          right outcome at the right time when sensing, decision-making,
          and adaptation are continuously informed and amplified by artificial intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI does not replace human judgment within this model. It enhances situational
          awareness, pattern recognition, and decision velocity.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Business AI</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Business AI</strong> refers to the subset of artificial intelligence
          that can be applied to deliver business value in the present context.
        </p>
        <p>
          It narrows focus. It prioritizes relevance. It enables action starting now.
          Business AI allows professionals to pivot intelligently without attempting
          to master the entire AI domain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Business AI is a component of Agile AI, not a replacement for Agility.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Humics</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Humics</strong> represents the human, cultural, cognitive,
          and ethical dimensions that shape how artificial intelligence is understood,
          trusted, governed, and integrated into decision systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without Humics, AI adoption risks becoming technologically driven
          but socially fragile.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Agile AI</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Agile AI</strong> is an integrated organizational capability that combines:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Agility</strong> — outcome-focused adaptation under uncertainty</li>
          <li><strong>Business AI</strong> — focused AI for present-value creation</li>
          <li><strong>Humics</strong> — human-centered governance and integration</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
          Agile AI = Agility + Business AI + Humics
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Agile AI should be understood as a systems capability — not a toolset,
          not a software stack, and not a training course.
        </p>
      </section>

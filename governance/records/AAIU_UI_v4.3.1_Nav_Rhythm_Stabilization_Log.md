AAIU Governance Log UI Layer Micro-Refinement Version: v4.3.1 ---
Navigation Rhythm Stabilization Surface: learn.agileai.university Date:
2026-02-12 Authority: Institutional UX Refinement (Non-Structural)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Context

Following UI v4.3 stabilization and mobile hardening, a minor visual
imbalance was observed in desktop navigation spacing.

While not functionally incorrect, spacing rhythm and hover motion
required institutional polish to align with brand tone: calm, academic,
deliberate.

This refinement was cosmetic and did not alter structure, logic, theme
handling, or accessibility behavior.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objective

Enhance visual rhythm and navigation polish without:

-   Changing layout architecture
-   Affecting responsive behavior
-   Altering theme system
-   Introducing JS changes
-   Modifying mobile behavior
-   Affecting accessibility

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes Introduced

Navigation Refinements:

-   Gap reduced from 28px → 22px for improved rhythm
-   Hover lift softened (-2px → -1px)
-   Subtle opacity easing added
-   Underline thickness reduced for institutional tone
-   Vertical breathing adjusted via link padding

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Integrity Verification

-   Theme rotation intact
-   Mobile stacking intact
-   Reading progress intact
-   Accessibility focus ring intact
-   Reduced motion respected
-   Header blur behavior unchanged
-   No JS dependencies modified

Risk Assessment: Zero (Cosmetic only)

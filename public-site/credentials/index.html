       CREDENTIALS OVERVIEW
  ========================== -->

  <section>
    <h1>Professional Credentials</h1>

    <p>
      Agile AI University issues professional credentials that formally recognize
      advanced capability, applied mastery, and leadership readiness
      in Agile AI and Agile Agentic AI domains.
    </p>

    <p>
      Credentials are governed academic recognitions — not participation badges,
      attendance certificates, or micro-credentials.
    </p>
  </section>

       ASSESSMENTS VS CREDENTIALS
  ========================== -->

  <section>
    <h2>Assessments and Credentials</h2>

    <p>
      Capability assessments offered by Agile AI University are diagnostic tools.
      They support self-reflection, pathway alignment, and professional insight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Assessments do not confer credentials.
      Credentials are governed separately under formal academic and professional criteria.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- =========================
       VERIFICATION

    <h1>Mission & Purpose</h1>

    <p>
      The mission of Agile AI University is to establish
      <strong>clear, defensible, and professionally relevant standards</strong>
      for Agile AI and Agentic AI capability.
    </p>

    <p>
      As artificial intelligence increasingly shapes organizational decisions
      and execution, professionals require more than tools or techniques —
      they require structured understanding, ethical grounding, and systems awareness.

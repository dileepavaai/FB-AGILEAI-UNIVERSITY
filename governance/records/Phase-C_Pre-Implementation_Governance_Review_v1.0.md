# 🔒 Phase-C Pre-Implementation Governance Review (v1.0)

**Organization:** Agile AI University  
**System:** Credential Architecture, Sharing & Verification  
**Phase:** Phase-C — Extended Credential Artifacts  
**Review Type:** Pre-Implementation Governance Review  
**Status:** REVIEWED · AUTHORIZED TO IMPLEMENT  
**Change Authority:** ❌ NONE (scope locked)  
**Review Date:** [DD Mon YYYY]

---

## 1️⃣ Purpose of This Record

This document records the **formal governance review of Phase-C readiness prior to implementation**.

Its purpose is to confirm that:
- Phase-C design is complete
- Scope is fully governed
- No architectural or governance risks remain unresolved
- Implementation may proceed without further design decisions

This record does **not** declare Phase-C complete or frozen.

---

## 2️⃣ Governance Context

Phase-C follows:
- Phase-B (FINAL · LOCKED · SHIPPED)
- Phase-B → Phase-C Transition Record (approved)
- Phase-C Governance Charter (v1.0)

All prior phases remain unchanged and authoritative.

---

## 3️⃣ Review Method

The review was conducted using:
- Phase-C Implementation Checklist (v1.0)
- Certificate & Trainer schemas
- PDF pipeline definitions
- Storage & access control rules
- Lifecycle & revocation rules

Each checklist item was evaluated for:
- Design completeness
- Governance compliance
- Risk containment

---

## 4️⃣ Checklist Walkthrough Summary

### Governance Preconditions
- Phase-B lock verified
- Required governance records present
- No open exceptions

**Result:** ✅ PASSED

---

### Scope Validation
- Only authorized Phase-C artifacts defined
- No credential issuance, sharing, or verification changes
- No OpenGraph or public exposure introduced

**Result:** ✅ PASSED

---

### University Certificate Design
- Schema finalized (v1.0)
- Visual mockup approved (non-celebratory, institutional)
- PDF pipeline defined (reportlab, embedded fonts)
- Reusable service module drafted

**Result:** ✅ DESIGN COMPLETE

---

### Trainer Authorization Design
- Role-based, time-bound authorization model defined
- Lifecycle states governed
- Revocation and expiry rules explicit
- Separate PDF service drafted

**Result:** ✅ DESIGN COMPLETE

---

### Storage & Access Controls
- Non-public storage mandated
- User-initiated access only
- No public URLs or indexing
- Independent revocation enforced

**Result:** ✅ DESIGN COMPLETE

---

### Architectural Integrity
- No mutation of credential records
- No UI-driven entitlements
- Verification system remains canonical
- Phase-B files remain untouched

**Result:** ✅ PRESERVED

---

## 5️⃣ Identified Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Status | Mitigation |
|----|------|-----------|
| Credential dilution | Eliminated | Certificates are representational only |
| Trainer treated as certification | Eliminated | Explicit role-based framing |
| Public exposure | Eliminated | Storage & access controls |
| Scope creep during build | Mitigated | Checklist + freeze gate |

No unresolved risks remain.

---

## 6️⃣ Authorization to Implement

Based on this review:

> **Phase-C is authorized to proceed to implementation**  
> strictly within the defined governance envelope.

No additional scope, artifacts, or behaviors may be introduced without:
- Explicit governance unlock
- New or amended governance records

---

## 7️⃣ Explicit Non-Authorization

This review does **not**:
- Declare Phase-C complete
- Freeze Phase-C
- Authorize public exposure
- Authorize new sharing mechanisms

Those actions require a **Phase-C Freeze Record**.

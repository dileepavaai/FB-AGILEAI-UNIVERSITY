    <h1>Credential Framework</h1>

    <p>
      Credentials issued by Agile AI University represent
      <strong>formal professional recognition</strong>
      aligned to defined capability standards and governance frameworks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Credentialing is governed independently and is not
      automatically granted through assessments, attendance,
      or participation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= PURPOSE ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Purpose of Credentialing</h2>

    <p>
      The purpose of credentialing is to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>formally recognize advanced professional capability</li>
      <li>protect professional and institutional credibility</li>
      <li>avoid dilution of professional standards</li>
      <li>ensure consistency across issued recognitions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Credentials are designed to serve employers,
      professionals, and the broader ecosystem —
      not short-term commercial objectives.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= SEPARATION FROM ASSESSMENT ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Separation from Capability Assessment</h2>

    <p>
      Open capability assessments published by Agile AI University
      are designed as <strong>insight and reflection instruments</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      They do not:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>confer credentials</li>
      <li>imply professional status</li>
      <li>serve as eligibility screening</li>
      <li>trigger automatic enrollment</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This separation preserves academic integrity
      and protects professionals from misleading claims.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= ELIGIBILITY ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Credential Eligibility</h2>

    <p>
      Credentials may be issued only under approved
      professional tracks and governed programs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eligibility is evaluated based on:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>demonstrated professional experience</li>
      <li>capability alignment with defined standards</li>
      <li>completion of approved learning or validation pathways</li>
      <li>adherence to ethical and professional expectations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Eligibility criteria are applied deliberately,
      not automatically.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= GOVERNANCE ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Credential Governance</h2>

    <p>
      All credentials are governed under
      formally approved academic and equivalency frameworks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Governance provisions include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>defined scope and intent of each credential</li>
      <li>issuance and approval controls</li>
      <li>review and audit mechanisms</li>
      <li>revocation and correction policies</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Governance ensures that credentials retain
      long-term professional value.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= VERIFICATION ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Verification & Authenticity</h2>

    <p>
      Credentials issued by Agile AI University
      may be verified through official verification channels.
    </p>

    <p>
      Verification confirms:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>credential authenticity</li>
      <li>issuance status</li>
      <li>governing framework alignment</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Open capability assessments do not require
      credential verification.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Professional Responsibility</h2>

    <p>
      Credential holders are expected to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>represent credentials accurately</li>
      <li>avoid misrepresentation or exaggeration</li>
      <li>act in alignment with ethical standards</li>
      <li>respect the boundaries of credential scope</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Misuse or misrepresentation may result
      in review or revocation.

Agile AI University Governance Record --- Public Learning Surface UI
v4.2 Stabilization

Date: 12 February 2026 Layer: Public Learning Surface
(learn.agileai.university) Classification: UI Stability Hardening
Version: v4.2 Status: LOCKED

1.  Purpose This governance record documents the controlled
    stabilization and mobile hardening of the Public Learning Surface
    following the formal freeze of UI v4.

The objective was not redesign, but deterministic reinforcement for: -
Mobile compatibility - iPad and tablet optimization - Navigation
robustness - Touch accessibility compliance - Structural layout
consistency

No visual identity changes were introduced.

2.  Scope of Change

A. Navigation Stabilization - Explicit flex definition for nav layout -
Deterministic stacking for mobile viewports - Improved alignment under
768px

B. Header Adaptation - Header inner layout responsive stacking -
Improved padding scaling - Blur background retained but stabilized

C. Content Layout Hardening - Margin adjustments for mobile - Font
scaling under 1024px - Improved text readability density

D. Touch Accessibility - 44px minimum touch targets enforced - Preserved
focus-ring accessibility layer

E. No Change Areas - Theme engine (3-state deterministic system) -
Reading progress system - Ripple system - Accessibility core -
Governance boundary architecture - Institutional positioning

3.  Architectural Impact Impact Level: Low (Controlled Surface Layer
    Only) No backend changes No Firebase changes No Portal integration
    changes No Assessment logic changes

The change remains strictly within assets/css/site.css.

4.  Strategic Context Majority of users are mobile-first. UI v4.2
    ensures:

-   Institutional readability
-   Touch-device compatibility
-   Cross-device consistency
-   Surface confidence

This update supports revenue execution readiness without destabilizing
architecture.

5.  Freeze Declaration Public Learning Surface UI v4.2 is hereby frozen
    as: Stable, mobile-compatible, governance-aligned, production-ready
    surface.

Further UI changes require governance entry.

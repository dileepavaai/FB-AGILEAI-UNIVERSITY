# 🔒 Phase-C Governance Charter (v1.0)

**Organization:** Agile AI University  
**System:** Credential Architecture, Sharing & Verification  
**Phase:** Phase-C — Extended Credential Artifacts  
**Status:** AUTHORIZED TO EXECUTE (WITH CONSTRAINTS)  
**Effective Date:** 21 Jan 2026  
**Supersedes:** None  
**Change Authority:** ❌ NONE (unless explicitly unlocked)

---

## 1️⃣ Purpose of Phase-C

Phase-C governs the creation and management of **extended credential artifacts** that
**represent already-issued credentials** without altering:

- Credential issuance
- Credential validity
- Credential entitlement
- Verification authority
- Public sharing semantics locked in Phase-B

**Primary objective:**  
Provide **formal, institution-grade documentation artifacts** (e.g., certificates, trainer authorizations) while preserving the neutrality, trust, and verifiability of the core credential system.

---

## 2️⃣ Preconditions (MANDATORY)

Phase-C execution is permitted only because:

- Phase-B is **FINAL · LOCKED · SHIPPED**
- A Phase-B → Phase-C Transition Record exists
- No unresolved governance exceptions are open

If any of these conditions cease to be true, Phase-C authority is automatically suspended.

---

## 3️⃣ Authorized Scope (EXPLICIT)

Phase-C MAY implement **only** the following artifact categories:

### A. University Certificate PDFs
- Formal institutional documents
- Non-interactive
- Downloadable
- Intended for HR, compliance, and documentation use
- Not designed for social sharing

### B. Trainer / Facilitator Authorization Artifacts
- Role-based authority documents
- Separate from professional credentials
- Explicitly non-certifying
- Governed as permissions, not achievements

### C. Controlled Distribution Mechanisms
- User-initiated downloads
- Optional email delivery (non-persistent)
- No public indexing or discovery

---

## 4️⃣ Explicitly Out of Scope (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Phase-C must **not**:

- Modify credential issuance rules
- Introduce eligibility or entitlement logic
- Alter credential validity or terminology
- Change OpenGraph or social preview behavior
- Add new public sharing mechanisms
- Introduce assessments, scoring, ranking, or grading
- Create skill validation or evaluative claims

Any such change requires declaration of a **new governance phase**.

---

## 5️⃣ Artifact Classification Rules

### University Certificates
Certificates produced in Phase-C must:

- Reference the **canonical Credential ID**
- Link back to the **public credential record**
- Clearly state:
  - Issued by Agile AI University
  - Validity: Lifetime (where applicable)
- Avoid any implication of:
  - Examination
  - Ranking
  - Skill assessment
  - Endorsement beyond issuance

### Trainer Authorization Artifacts
Trainer artifacts must:

- Explicitly state scope and limits of authority
- Avoid credential-like framing
- Remain separate from public credential listings
- Be revocable independently of credentials

---

## 6️⃣ Architectural Constraints (CARRIED FORWARD)

Phase-C inherits all architectural guarantees from earlier phases:

- Rendering layers remain read-only
- No UI-driven entitlement logic
- No backend mutation of credential records
- Verification remains public and independent
- Credential registry remains display-only

---

## 7️⃣ Language & Tone Rules (MANDATORY)

All Phase-C artifacts must use language that is:

- Institutional
- Calm
- Precise
- Outcome-neutral

They must explicitly avoid:

- Marketing language
- Celebratory framing
- “Achievement” narratives
- Skill validation claims
- Coaching, training, or promotional tone

---

## 8️⃣ Governance Enforcement

- Phase-C work must not modify Phase-B artifacts
- Any ambiguity must be resolved **in favor of governance**
- Violations require:
  - Immediate halt of implementation
  - Governance review
  - Creation of a new, versioned governance record

Silent deviation is not permitted.

---

## 9️⃣ Phase-C Completion & Freeze Criteria

Phase-C may be declared **FINAL · LOCKED** only when:

- All authorized artifacts are implemented
- No scope leakage is present
- All artifacts correctly reference canonical credentials
- A Phase-C Governance Record (PDF) is produced
- Any next-phase transition is formally recorded

---

## 🔒 Final Declaration

> This Phase-C Governance Charter (v1.0) authorizes execution **only within the constraints defined above**.  
>  
> Any deviation requires an explicit governance unlock and a superseding charter version.

**Issued by:** Governance Authority  
**Date:** 21 Jan 2026

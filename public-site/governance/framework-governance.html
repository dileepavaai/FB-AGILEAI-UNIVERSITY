    <h1>Framework Governance Charter</h1>

    <p>
      This charter defines the governance principles under which
      institutional capability frameworks are defined,
      maintained, versioned, and interpreted by Agile AI University.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= INSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>1. Institutional Authority</h2>

    <p>
      Capability frameworks published by Agile AI University
      are issued as institutional reference models.
    </p>

    <p>
      Framework definitions are established under academic
      and governance review and are not subject to ad hoc modification.
    </p>

    <p>
      Interpretations, assessments, or derivative instruments
      must remain aligned to the officially defined framework version.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= VERSION INTEGRITY ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>2. Version Integrity</h2>

    <p>
      Each framework maintains explicit version notation
      (e.g., AAOC v1.0).
    </p>

    <p>
      Version updates are introduced deliberately and documented clearly.
      Changes are not made reactively in response to trends,
      marketing incentives, or short-term positioning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Prior versions remain historically valid institutional references.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= STRUCTURAL STABILITY ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>3. Structural Stability</h2>

    <p>
      Core dimensional architecture, classification thresholds,
      and definitional boundaries are preserved across minor revisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Structural changes require formal review and
      may result in a major version increment.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= INTERPRETIVE SEPARATION ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>4. Interpretive Separation</h2>

    <p>
      Structural classification models and interpretive instruments
      are maintained as distinct layers.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The <strong>Classification Layer</strong> defines capability domains,
        indicators, and rule-based threshold mapping.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <strong>Interpretive Layer</strong> provides contextual analysis,
        executive implications, or governance interpretation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Interpretive outputs do not modify or override foundational scoring logic.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= BOUNDARY PRESERVATION ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>5. Boundary Preservation</h2>

    <p>
      To maintain institutional neutrality and long-term integrity,
      Agile AI University frameworks:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>do not prescribe vendors, platforms, or implementation tools</li>
      <li>do not function as certification marketing instruments</li>
      <li>are not optimized for commercial positioning</li>
      <li>are not modified for promotional leverage</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Frameworks serve as structured academic reference systems.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= TRANSPARENCY PRINCIPLE ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>6. Transparency Principle</h2>

    <p>
      Framework methodology, dimensional definitions,
      and classification logic are described publicly
      to ensure clarity of institutional intent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Transparency of structure strengthens legitimacy
      and reduces perception risk.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= STEWARDSHIP ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>7. Stewardship</h2>

    <p>
      Stewardship responsibility for institutional frameworks
      resides with the Academic and Governance authority
      of Agile AI University.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stewardship includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>periodic review for conceptual coherence</li>
      <li>ethical boundary oversight</li>
      <li>version documentation</li>
      <li>interpretive consistency</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= CURRENT ACTIVE FRAMEWORK ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>8. Current Active Framework</h2>

    <p>
      As of 2026, the active institutional capability model is:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Applied Agile AI Orchestration Capability (AAOC) Framework — v1.0</strong>
    </p>

    <p>

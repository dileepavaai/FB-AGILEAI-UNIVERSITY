  <!-- INSTITUTIONAL DECLARATION -->
  <section>
    <h1>About Agile AI University</h1>

    <p>
      Agile AI University operates as an independent institutional authority
      defining structured capability architecture for AI-enabled agility.
    </p>

    <p>
      The institution establishes formal frameworks, governed assessment systems,
      and structured professional recognition models designed to clarify what
      integrated capability means in Agile AI and Agentic AI environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Its mandate is architectural rather than commercial.
      The institution defines standards and evaluation structures;
      it does not function as a training marketplace, certification vendor,
      or recruitment intermediary.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- INSTITUTIONAL POSITIONING (ALIGNED EXACTLY TO LOCKED DIMENSIONS) -->
  <section>
    <h2>Institutional Positioning</h2>

    <p>
      Agile AI University provides structured reference baselines
      for capability definition across five structured capability dimensions:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Agile Execution Capability</li>
      <li>AI Conceptual Fluency</li>
      <li>Systems Thinking</li>
      <li>Ethics, Trust &amp; Human Impact</li>
      <li>Outcome-Based System Prompting</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These dimensions are operationalized through a governed
      25-question capability assessment system designed for
      professional orientation and executive-level insight.
    </p>

    <p>
      The institution maintains explicit separation between
      framework definition, assessment instrumentation,
      executive interpretation, and credential issuance.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- STRUCTURAL SCOPE -->
  <section>
    <h2>Scope of Institutional Work</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Definition of structured Agile AI capability architecture</li>
      <li>Development of governed multi-dimensional assessment instruments</li>
      <li>Maintenance of formal academic and professional reference frameworks</li>
      <li>Alignment of professional recognition to defined capability standards</li>
      <li>Preservation of governance boundaries across institutional functions</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- GOVERNANCE FOUNDATION -->
  <section>
    <h2>Governance Foundation</h2>

    <p>
      Institutional credibility is preserved through structural separation,
      version-controlled change management, and long-term orientation
      over short-term expansion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Frameworks, assessments, and recognition pathways are maintained
      under formal governance protocols designed to prevent structural drift
      and credential dilution.
    </p>

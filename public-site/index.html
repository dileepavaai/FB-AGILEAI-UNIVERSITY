  <!-- INSTITUTIONAL ROLE -->
  <section>
    <h2>Institutional Role</h2>

    <p>
      Agile AI University defines structured professional capability
      within Agile AI and Agentic AI environments through formal
      architectural models rather than tool-based or trend-driven approaches.
    </p>

    <p>
      The institution provides reference baselines for capability definition,
      structured multi-dimensional evaluation, and governed professional
      recognition pathways.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CAPABILITY ARCHITECTURE -->
  <section>
    <h2>Capability Architecture</h2>

    <div class="pillar">
      <h3>Structured Capability Dimensions</h3>
      <p>
        A defined five-dimension capability model comprising:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Agile Execution Capability</li>
        <li>AI Conceptual Fluency</li>
        <li>Systems Thinking</li>
        <li>Ethics, Trust &amp; Human Impact</li>
        <li>Outcome-Based System Prompting</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="pillar">
      <h3>Formal Frameworks</h3>
      <p>
        Institutionally maintained architectural models clarifying
        governance boundaries within Agile AI practice.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pillar">
      <h3>Multi-Dimensional Assessment</h3>
      <p>
        A structured 25-question capability evaluation system
        operationalizing the five defined capability dimensions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="pillar">
      <h3>Governed Recognition Pathways</h3>
      <p>
        Professional recognition models aligned to defined capability standards,
        institutionally separated from assessment mechanisms.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT -->
  <section>
    <h2>Agile + AI Capability Assessment</h2>

    <p>
      The Agile + AI Capability Assessment provides structured insight
      across the five defined capability dimensions:
      Agile Execution Capability,
      AI Conceptual Fluency,
      Systems Thinking,
      Ethics, Trust &amp; Human Impact,
      and Outcome-Based System Prompting.
    </p>

    <p>
      The assessment functions as an institutional insight instrument.
      It does not operate as an examination, hiring filter,
      or automatic certification mechanism.
    </p>

  <!-- PROFESSIONAL RECOGNITION -->
  <section>
    <h2>Professional Recognition</h2>

    <p>
      Credentials issued under Agile AI University represent
      structured professional recognition aligned to formally
      defined capability architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recognition pathways remain institutionally separated from
      assessment systems to preserve governance integrity.

  <!-- GOVERNANCE -->
  <section>
    <h2>Governance & Institutional Integrity</h2>

    <p>
      Agile AI University operates within explicit governance boundaries
      separating frameworks, assessment architecture, recognition pathways,
      and implementation layers.
    </p>

    <p>
      This structural separation protects institutional neutrality
      and preserves long-term academic credibility.

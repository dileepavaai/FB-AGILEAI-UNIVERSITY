      Institutional Framework Definition
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Framework:</strong> Applied Agile AI Orchestration Capability (AAOC)<br />
      <strong>Version:</strong> v1.0<br />
      <strong>Status:</strong> Active Institutional Reference Model
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>1. Framework Overview</h2>

    <p>
      The Applied Agile AI Orchestration Capability (AAOC) Framework
      is a structured academic capability classification model
      defined and maintained by Agile AI University.
    </p>

    <p>
      The framework evaluates how Agile execution discipline,
      Artificial Intelligence fluency, systemic coherence,
      ethical governance, and outcome-based orchestration
      integrate within professional and organizational environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      AAOC is designed as a rule-based developmental classification model.
      It does not function as a psychometric instrument,
      predictive assessment, hiring filter, or behavioral scoring engine.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= DIMENSIONAL ARCHITECTURE ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>2. Dimensional Architecture (5 × 5 Model)</h2>

    <p>
      The AAOC framework is structured as a 5 × 5 capability matrix,
      evaluating five defined domains across five structured indicators
      within each domain (25 total indicators).
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Agile Execution Discipline</strong><br />
        Alignment of adaptability, outcome clarity, and learning integration within execution systems.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>AI Conceptual Fluency</strong><br />
        Structured understanding of AI capabilities, limitations, and responsible decision integration.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Systems Coherence</strong><br />
        Recognition of interdependencies, feedback dynamics, and long-term systemic effects.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Ethical Governance & Trust</strong><br />
        Explicit consideration of responsibility, transparency, accountability, and human impact.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Outcome-Based System Prompting</strong><br />
        Structured articulation of intent, measurable outputs, and disciplined orchestration of AI-enabled workflows.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= CLASSIFICATION METHODOLOGY ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>3. Classification Methodology</h2>

    <p>
      Responses within AAOC-aligned instruments are interpreted
      using standardized threshold evaluation.
      Domain-level averages are mapped to structured maturity classifications:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Foundational</strong> – Capability characteristics are emerging, reactive, or inconsistent.</li>
      <li><strong>Emerging</strong> – Capability characteristics are visible and developing with partial integration.</li>
      <li><strong>Integrated</strong> – Capability characteristics operate coherently across execution, governance, and decision systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The classification reflects developmental posture rather than performance scoring.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= INTERPRETIVE SEPARATION ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>4. Interpretive Layers</h2>

    <p>
      The AAOC framework operates across two distinct interpretive layers:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Insight Classification Layer</strong> –
        Structured capability description based on rule-based threshold evaluation.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Executive Interpretation Layer</strong> –
        Contextual analysis relating to governance exposure,
        leadership accountability, and AI-enabled decision authority.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Executive interpretation extends beyond structural classification
      and is maintained separately from foundational scoring logic.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= INSTITUTIONAL POSITIONING ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>5. Institutional Positioning</h2>

    <p>
      Agile AI University defines structured academic frameworks,
      capability standards, and professional recognition models
      within the Agile AI domain.
    </p>

    <p>
      The AAOC framework is maintained as an institutional reference model
      and may evolve through formal version updates governed under
      established institutional review principles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Governance principles for framework maintenance are defined in the
      <a href="/governance/framework-governance.html">
        Framework Governance Charter
      </a>.
    </p>

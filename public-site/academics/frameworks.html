    <h1>Academic Frameworks</h1>

    <p>
      Agile AI University defines formal academic frameworks
      to establish shared understanding, professional clarity,
      and reference standards for Agile AI and Agentic AI capability.
    </p>

    <p>
      These frameworks are not methodologies, tools, or training models.
      They serve as <strong>conceptual and professional reference systems</strong>
      for experienced practitioners, leaders, educators, and institutions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= FRAMEWORK PURPOSE ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Purpose of the Frameworks</h2>

    <p>
      The primary purpose of Agile AI University frameworks is to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>define core dimensions of Agile AI capability</li>
      <li>clarify boundaries between Agile, AI, and Agentic systems</li>
      <li>establish common professional language and reference</li>
      <li>support assessment, governance, and credential alignment</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The frameworks are intentionally designed to remain
      independent of specific tools, vendors, platforms,
      or commercial interests.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= CORE DIMENSIONS ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Core Capability Dimensions</h2>

    <p>
      Agile AI capability is understood as an integrated system
      across multiple professional dimensions:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Agile Execution</strong><br />
        Adaptive execution, flow, and learning in complex environments.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>AI Conceptual Fluency</strong><br />
        Understanding AI as a decision-influencing capability,
        not merely automation or tooling.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Systems Thinking</strong><br />
        Recognition of interdependencies, feedback loops,
        and system-wide behavior.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Ethics, Trust & Human Impact</strong><br />
        Responsible design and deployment of AI
        with societal and organizational awareness.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Change & Learning Orientation</strong><br />
        Continuous learning, adaptation,
        and co-evolution of people and systems.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= AGENTIC AI CONTEXT ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Agentic AI Context</h2>

    <p>
      Agile AI University frameworks distinguish clearly
      between traditional AI-enabled systems
      and <strong>Agentic AI</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Agentic AI refers to systems capable of:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>delegated decision-making within defined boundaries</li>
      <li>autonomous action aligned to human intent</li>
      <li>feedback-driven learning and adjustment</li>
      <li>governed responsibility and accountability</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Frameworks emphasize that agentic capability
      requires strong governance, ethical clarity,
      and professional judgment.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= ACADEMIC BOUNDARIES ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Academic Boundaries</h2>

    <p>
      To preserve integrity and long-term relevance,
      Agile AI University frameworks maintain strict boundaries:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>they do not prescribe tools or implementation recipes</li>
      <li>they are not positioned as certifications or curricula</li>
      <li>they are not optimized for marketing or adoption metrics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Their role is to provide stable reference standards
      that can evolve deliberately over time.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= EVOLUTION ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Framework Evolution</h2>

    <p>
      Academic frameworks are reviewed periodically
      to ensure continued relevance,
      ethical responsibility,
      and alignment with emerging AI practices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Changes are introduced cautiously
      to avoid reactive or trend-driven shifts.

    <h1>Start Here: Understanding Agile AI</h1>

    <p>
      This page is intended for professionals, leaders, and practitioners who are encountering
      the term <strong>Agile AI</strong> and want a clear, grounded understanding before forming
      opinions, making decisions, or pursuing any formal recognition.
    </p>

    <p>
      The material linked from this page is public, non-instructional, and designed to establish
      shared language and conceptual clarity in a rapidly evolving domain.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Orientation Exists</h2>

    <p>
      Artificial intelligence is changing how decisions are made, how work is organized, and how
      leadership accountability is exercised. At the same time, widely used terms such as
      <em>Agility</em>, <em>Business AI</em>, and <em>AI readiness</em> are often used
      inconsistently or incorrectly.
    </p>

    <p>
      This orientation exists to address that gap. Before tools, before frameworks, and before
      certification, there must be clarity.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Use This Page</h2>

    <p>
      You do not need to read everything at once. There is no required sequence, no completion,
      and no assessment. The sections below reflect a <strong>recommended reading path</strong>
      for building a coherent mental model — not a learning requirement.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Definitions</h2>

    <h3>Agility</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Agility</strong> is the capability to deliver the right outcome at the right time
      under conditions of uncertainty.
    </p>

    <h3>AI-augmented Agility</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>AI-augmented Agility</strong> is the capability to deliver the right outcome at the
      right time when sensing, decision-making, and adaptation are continuously informed and
      amplified by artificial intelligence.
    </p>

    <h3>Agile AI</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Agile AI</strong> is an integrated organizational capability that combines:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Agility</strong> — outcome-focused adaptation under uncertainty</li>
      <li><strong>Business AI</strong> — the focused use of AI to deliver business value now</li>
      <li><strong>Humics</strong> — the human, cultural, cognitive, and ethical dimensions that
        shape how AI is understood, trusted, and governed</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      Agile AI = Agility + Business AI + Humics
    </blockquote>

    <h2>What Is Business AI (and Why It Matters Now)</h2>

    <p>
      Artificial intelligence as a field is vast, fast-moving, and impossible for any individual
      to master fully. Attempting to “learn all of AI” is neither realistic nor necessary for
      most professionals.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Business AI</strong> narrows the focus. It refers to the subset of artificial
      intelligence that can be applied to deliver business value in the present context — enabling
      decisions, actions, and outcomes starting now, not at an undefined point in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      Business AI helps professionals focus, prioritize relevance, and pivot intelligently as
      conditions change. It is a core component of Agile AI, not a replacement for it.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Myths and Misconceptions</h2>

    <p>
      Many misunderstandings block effective use of AI in organizations. Common myths include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Agility is about speed or delivery frameworks</li>
      <li>AI is primarily a technology or automation problem</li>
      <li>Leaders do not need to understand AI to govern its use</li>
      <li>Professionals must learn all of AI to remain relevant</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Addressing these misconceptions is essential before discussing tools, practices, or
      credentials.
    </p>

    <h2>What Comes After Orientation</h2>

    <p>
      Some readers stop after achieving conceptual clarity. Others continue toward applied
      practice, assessment, or formal recognition. Where relevant, those pathways are provided
      through the Student &amp; Executive Portal and are intentionally separated from this public
      learning surface.
    </p>

    <h2>Boundary Statement</h2>

    <p>
      This orientation is not a course, certification program, or learning management system.
      It does not teach tools, prescribe practices, or assess competence. Its purpose is shared
      understanding.

# Cross-Surface CSS Divergence Policy
Agile AI University

Version: 1.0  
Status: ACTIVE

---

## 1. Core Principle

Not all surfaces should evolve together.

CSS divergence across surfaces is intentional,
not accidental.

---

## 2. Surface Categories

### Evolving Surfaces
- public-site
- academic frameworks
- research pages

These may:
- Introduce new UI patterns
- Refine spacing and typography
- Add institutional indicators
- Update visual hierarchy

---

### Frozen Operational Surfaces
- verify.agileai.university
- certs.agileai.university

These must:
- Maintain stable visual identity
- Avoid aesthetic refinements
- Avoid version signaling
- Avoid experimental UI patterns

---

## 3. Synchronization Rules

Automatic CSS sync across surfaces is PROHIBITED.

Before copying CSS from one surface to another:

You must answer:

1. Is this change required for security?
2. Is this change required for accessibility compliance?
3. Is this change required for structural integrity?
4. Is this change required due to third-party structural shift?

If the answer is “no” to all:
→ Do not sync.

---

## 4. Divergence Is Not Drift

Divergence is controlled.
Drift is accidental.

Divergence must be:
- Intentional
- Documented
- Committed with clear rationale

---

## 5. Long-Term Architectural View

Institutional credibility increases when:

- Presentation evolves deliberately
- Operational surfaces remain stable

The goal is separation of:
Brand evolution
vs
Trust-critical infrastructure
